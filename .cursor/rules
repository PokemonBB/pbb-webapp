# Cursor Rules for PokemonBattleBrawl WebApp

## Code Language and Style

- **Always write code in English**: variables, functions, classes, documentation, comments
- **Minimal comments**: Only add comments when absolutely necessary to explain complex logic or business rules
- **No code documentation**: Avoid documenting obvious code functionality
- **Self-documenting code**: Use descriptive names that explain the purpose

### Code Standards

- Use **PascalCase** for classes and interfaces
- Use **camelCase** for variables and functions
- Use **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE** for constants
- Prefer **composition over inheritance**
- Use **dependency injection** for services
- Follow **SOLID principles**

### Development Guidelines

- Always use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer async/await over Promises
- Use proper error handling with NestJS exceptions
- Follow the existing code patterns in the project
- Keep controllers thin, business logic in services
- Use DTOs for request/response validation
